# This file contains default .gitignore rules. To use it, copy it to .gitignore,
# and it will cause files like your settings.php and user-uploaded files to be
# excluded from Git version control. This is a common strategy to avoid
# accidentally including private information in public repositories and patch
# files.
#
# Because .gitignore can be specific to your site, this file has a different
# name; updating Drupal core will not override your custom .gitignore file.

# Ignore core when managing all of a project's dependencies with Composer
# including Drupal core.
/core/

# Ignore directories generated by Composer
#
# See the "installer-paths" section in the top-level composer.json
# file.

# moved to root .gitignore file
# # Ignore dependencies that are managed with Composer.
# # Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. It's important
# # that core/assets/vendor and any other vendor directories within contrib or
# # custom module, theme, etc., are not ignored unless you purposely do so.
# /vendor/

# Ignore configuration files that may contain sensitive information.
sites/*/settings*.php
sites/*/services*.yml

# Ignore paths that contain user-generated content.
sites/*/files
sites/*/private

# Ignore SimpleTest multi-site environment.
sites/simpletest

# Ignore scaffold files
#
# Note that the scaffold plugin may be used to automatically manage
# a site's .gitignore files. If the `vendor` directory is ignored,
# then one or more .gitignore files will be written to also ignore
# any file placed by scaffolding. To avoid the creation of
# additional .gitignore files, add all of the scaffold file
# locations to the top-level .gitignore file, as shown below.
